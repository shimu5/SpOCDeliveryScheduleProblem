    UDP (User-Defined Problem) for the Trappist-1 scheduling optimisation problem.
    This corresponds to the third challenge in SpOC (Space Optimisation Competition)
    conceived by the ACT for the GECCO 2022 conference.

    The challenge involves optimising the schedule for delivering asteroids to
    hypothetical processing stations in a differnt orbit in the far future.
    A more detailed overview of the problem scenario and the three challenges can be found here:

        - The chromosome has the following format:

            - Start and end times for each station, *in order of Station ID*
            - Asteroid / station assignments with the corresponding arrival times.

            Format:
            [
                Station 1 start time, Station 1 end time,   |
                Station 2 start time, Station 2 end time,   |
                ...                                         | 2 x number of stations
                Station 11 start time, Station 11 end time, |
                Station 12 start time, Station 12 end time, |
                Asteroid ID, Station ID, Opportunity ID, |
                Asteroid ID, Station ID, Opportunity ID, |
                ...                                      | number of asteroids
                Asteroid ID, Station ID, Opportunity ID, |
                Asteroid ID, Station ID, Opportunity ID  |
            ]

        - All IDs (for asteroids, stations and opportunities) are 1-based.
            - This is particularly relevant for the opportunity IDs
            since they are converted to 0-based indices in the fitness
            evaluation function by subtracting 1.

        - Stations must be activated *sequentially* (*not* in parallel) but not necessarily in order of their ID.

        - There must be a minimal gap (called 'station gap') between the end time of one station
        and the start time of the next.

        - Every asteroid must be either asigned to a station or unassigned.

        - The asteroid / station assignments do not have to be  in any particular order,
        but all asteroid IDs must appear in the chromosome, even if some asteroids are unassigned.

            - Assigned asteroids must have corresponding Station IDs between 1 and the number of stations.
            - Unassigned asteroids must have a Station ID 0.
